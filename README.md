This is an example of a created templated version on generating files for your eyes to see.

Things you may want to cover:

* All versions are listed in Gemfile.

* System dependencies = rbenv install 

* Database creation = postgres/SQL 

* Database initialization = rake 
   - normally I use rake with testing and developing 
   `rake db:drop db:create db:setup db:migrate`
* Database initialization = rails
    - rails on production 
      `rails db:drop db:create db:setup db:migrate`


* Deployment instructions
-`github push`
-`heroku push`
